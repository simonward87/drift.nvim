# Joi Theme

As a result of liking many themes, but not _loving_ any of them â€” I've decided
to make my own. I'm doing this partly because I'd like to learn the fundamentals
of writing a Neovim plugin using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), as well as in the
hope that I can make something that other will enjoy.

## Goals

- Meet
  [WCAG colour contrast guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast)
  for legibility
- Treat light theme as more than an afterthought
- Dripping with visual umami
